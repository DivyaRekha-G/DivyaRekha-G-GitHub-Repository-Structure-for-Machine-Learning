Day 1-2: Essential Linear Algebra & NumPy (ML Foundations)
Vectors & Matrices
Concepts:

Vectors: A vector is simply a one-dimensional array of numbers. It represents magnitude and direction. In ML, vectors are used to represent data points and features.
Matrices: A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. In machine learning, matrices represent datasets, where each row is a data point and each column represents a feature.

Real-World Application:

In machine learning, vectors and matrices are used to represent datasets (rows as data points, columns as features). For example, when working with a dataset of houses, each row could represent a house, and the columns could represent features like square footage, number of rooms, etc.

Matrix Multiplication
Concepts:

Matrix multiplication is crucial in machine learning, especially in algorithms like linear regression and neural networks. It's the process of multiplying two matrices, where the number of columns of the first matrix must match the number of rows of the second matrix.
It’s used to compute weighted sums in machine learning models, like in linear regression or neural networks.

Real-World Application:

In neural networks, the input data (features) is multiplied by the weight matrix to get the predictions.

Transpose, Inverse, Determinants
Concepts:

Transpose: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal. It swaps rows and columns.
Inverse: The inverse of a matrix A is a matrix that, when multiplied by A, results in the identity matrix. The inverse is essential in solving systems of linear equations, which is key in regression models.
Determinants: The determinant of a matrix provides information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible (if determinant ≠ 0).
Real-World Application:

The transpose is used in machine learning algorithms like linear regression for the normal equation.
The inverse is used in calculating solutions to linear systems.
Determinants help in checking if a matrix is invertible, which is important for algorithms like PCA.
